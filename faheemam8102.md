# Maximizing the efficiency of the stirling engine

## Summary

In this project, I would like to maximize the efficiency of a Stirling Engine. Stirling engines are fascinating in that they are able to take heat and convert that into mechanical energy. 
I also learned thermoelectric plates and how they are able to take heat and convert it directly into electicity. I have always been obsessed with energy and 
efficiency and know that if you combine these two together, it is possible to maximize the efficiency. I would love to experiment and try this out.

## Plan

First: get the stirling engine to work and measure the temperature output
Second: Connect a motor to the stirling engine in order to produce an electric current
Third: combine the thermoelectric plates with the stirling engine to create a new apparatus (figure out the best placement because both of these devices operate on a difference in temperature)
Fourth: calculate the efficiency and experiment with various other placements
