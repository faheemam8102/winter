# Experimenting with Heat and Electricity

## Summary

In this project, I would like to experiment with thermoelectric plates (peltier plates) and stirling engines. I would like to combin them into an appartus where I can measure the voltage supplied and the RPM produced from the stirling engines (This apparatus will be set up by a dual gamma type where the peltier plates will be in the middle and edge). I also learned thermoelectric plates and how they are able to take heat and convert it directly into electicity. I have always been obsessed with clean energy and would like to experiment from body heat and a way to convert the useless energy into useful energy. Another project I would really like to do is create a body heat converter that will take body and use it to power a load. The load can be a fan or a stirling engine fan that will faster as body temperature rises. NOTE: I am not an expert and would just like to get an exposure through an exciting project!

## Plan

First: get the stirling engine to work 
Second: Set up the gamma apparatus
Third: Place 2 peltier plates in the center and on the outsides of the engines
Fourth: Use the alpha stirling engine to power the apparatus
Fifth: measure the temperature of the alpha and the gammas
Sixth: measure the RPMs of the gamma engines and the voltage being supplied to the peltier plates
Seventh: Setup the peltier plates in a way to collect body heat when sitting
Eigth: Measure this voltage
Ninth: experiment!
